# Lambda Questions

## Question 1:
You have a list of strings ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date', 'elderberry']. Use the filter function and a lambda function to create a new list that contains only the strings with more than 5 characters.

- Input: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date', 'elderberry']
- Expected Output: ['banana', 'cherry', 'elderberry']

## Question 2:
Given a list of numbers [2, 4, 6, 8, 10], first use the map function and a lambda function to double each number. Then, use the reduce function to find the product of the doubled numbers.

- Input: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
- Expected Output: 46080 (Product of [4, 8, 12, 16, 20])

```
*Note: Expected Output is wrong, see below calculation:
2 x 4 x 6 x 8 x 10 = 3,840
4 x 8 x 12 x 16 x 20 = 122,880
```
